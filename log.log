Entry 6 (3/615):

Implement algorithms to:

compute BC-tree with iterator over biconnected components
compute SPQR tree decomposition with iterator
planarity check
ktree check

G is planar

combinatorial embedding
canonical ordering + iterator for faces
peeling ordering to levels 
Yannakakis' algorithm for 4-page
Nishizeki-Cluba's algorithm for hamilton cycle in 4-connected planar graph

G is not planar

find K33 subgraphs
find maximal bipartite subgraph
find maximal planar subgraph
create chordal graph and color it 
baur-braudez heuristic
he-sykora heuristic
find edge-seperator

TODO:
* Implement switching between Biconnected Components.
* Select/move many edges. Drag to select edges. Move edges using the keyboard.
* Option to reset zoom of pages.
* Uniform size of pages (at least on graph opening). Manual page resizing.
* Select page to be shown in a view. Show more than one pages in one view.
* Read from files with no labels (i.e. no information about book embedding).
